# Inspiration

I love remaking bite-sized games like this. As a developer, I get told not to reinvent the wheel, but what if I am curious about how the wheel was made? There are probably hundreds of variations of this game, but to me, the fun part is getting into the thought process of how something was built algorithmically and the nuances of that problem.
